VOLUNTEER RESULTS

PRESENTATION IDEAS
- Begin with descriptive stats on demo and program
- highlight strengths and weaknesses in current system
----- Disability, race inequality, states, etc
- Highlight (and quantify) benefits of volunteer services
- Where to move forward and create value?

DATA TO SOURCE
- Census to compare HH demo to American standard
- Census per state data?
- Demo of military for comparison
- Can we source what 'describes' people likely to use hiring assistance programs?
